[line number] - [comment about a mistake]

3 - implicit declaration of function 'g'
3 - 'a' is undeclared (first use in this function) - ERROR
4 - implicit declaration of function 's'
5 - comparison between pointer and integer (i < b);
6 - implicit declaration of function 'printf' ('<stdio.h>' is not included, neither function 'printf' is declared)
6 - local variables used in loop condition are not updated in the loop, which results in an infinite loop.
9 - conflicting types for 's'
9 - type of 'a' defaults to 'int' ('a' was not previously declared)
9 - type of 'l' defaults to 'int' ('l' was not previously declared)
12 - semicolon should not be at the end of for loop conditions and before the body.
14 - 'j' is undeclared (first use in this function) - ERROR - this is due to a previous error above, wrongly placed semicolon.
21 - ('void s(a, l)' function should have a closing bracket) - ERROR
22 - type of 'b' defaults to 'int' ('b' was not previously declared)
23 - implicit declaration of function 'scanf' ('<stdio.h>' is not included, neither function 'scanf' is declared)
23 - format '%d' expects argument of type 'int *', but argument 2 has type 'int'
25 - type of 'a' defaults to 'int' ('a' was not previously declared)
25 - type of 'b' defaults to 'int' ('b' was not previously declared)
27 - 'a' redeclared as different kind of symbol (after being defaulted to 'int' previously) - ERROR
27 - variable 'a' set but not used
28 - incompatible implicit declaration of function 'malloc' ('<stdlib.h>' is not included, neither function 'malloc' is declared)
29 - 'i' undeclared (first use in this function) - ERROR
29 - declaration of function 'rand' ('<stdlib.h>' is not included, neither function 'rand' is declared)
29 -  expected declaration or statement at end of input ('void g(a, b)' function should have a closing bracket) - ERROR
